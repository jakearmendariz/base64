# Base64 Encoder and Decoder

Encodes and decodes strings in base64

I wrote two versions, one in rust and one in python. The rust version is roughly 200% faster and 20% less code. Kinda just made this for fun, you can test them out by running ! cargo run "random string" and ! python3 test.py "random string"
